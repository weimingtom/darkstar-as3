# Project Darkstar Actionscript Client SDK #

This project provides a client library for [Project Darkstar](http://www.projectdarkstar.com).

## Latest Update ##

Darkstar-AS3 has been updated and tested with 0.9.8.  The example client is also now part of the source and binary distribution.  The project has switched to [flex mojos](http://code.google.com/p/flex-mojos/) for easy building from the command prompt.

## Supported Versions ##

The current version supports Project Darkstar 0.9.6, 0.9.7 and 0.9.8

## Example Usage ##

To get started, have a look at the example client [here](http://code.google.com/p/darkstar-as3/source/browse/trunk/example-client/src/main.mxml).  It has been tested with the [HelloUser and HelloChannel server examples](http://www.projectdarkstar.com/downloads/), and should be functionally equivalent to the HelloChannel client provided by the official Darkstar Java Client SDK.

## Known Bugs ##
